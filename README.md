#Hangeo

This is the final project for our "Discrete Math II" course in our university, we had to develop a full application implementing Graph Theory into real world problems and make an application that can be usefull for our market.

Our idea for the final project was to make an app, that allows our users to create they're hang out plans, allowing them to select different destinations and create the best route for them, allowing them also to share their plans with friends and family.

###Application
We decided to make our application in a technology we didn't knew, or only had the basics so we could do our project but at the same time learn some new coding skills. because it would be really boring to do all that theoric work and not have a little fun learning something new right? :P

- Language: Java
- Framework: Android
- Design Pattern: Material Design
